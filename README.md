# Snake project public
Snake project for class public repo

Snake was my first project in C!

This assignment required me to work directly with memory and data representations. We first had to set up a basic playable version of the game with customizable levels. Then we made it more like the original snake game by having it support a growing snake using a linked list data structure. Also implemented features to allow for player names to be included, and also different alphabets, including emojis!
