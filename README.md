Snake was my first project in C!

This assignment required me to work directly with memory and data representations. We first had to set up a basic playable version of the game with customizable levels. Then we made it more like the original snake game by having it support a growing snake using a linked list data structure. Also implemented features to allow for player names to be included, and also different alphabets, including emojis!

In this project here is a rundown of what I was able to do:

*  Practice writing code in the C programming language.
*  Understand how data is laid out in memory.
*  Learn how to work with pointers.
*  Become familiar with C strings, bitwise operations, and dynamic memory allocation (malloc and free).
*  Understand the difference between ASCII and Unicode character representations.
